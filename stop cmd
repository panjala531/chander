Old Libraries Exist, New Libraries Exist ----Likely safe to delete old ones (need to confirm Akash is not using them).

Old Libraries Do Not Exist:  --go back to Evergreen team and ask them to rerun the scan; data may be outdated.

 Akash is not using Anaconda libraries and his application installs only the needed packages from requirements.txt, you can uninstall Anaconda to clean up—

Discuss if his apps are still dependent on Anaconda or if everything is handled by requirements.txt——
If only old libraries exist, and no newer versions are found—— application still depends on the old versions——
Are these old libraries still actively used…?
