I would like to request your approval to increase our Snowflake warehouse from SMALL to MEDIUM.

This change is needed to ensure smooth operations during role-based execution â€” LQT will use the LQT role/warehouse while ARI will use the ARI role/warehouse. This setup helps avoid disconnects during operational rotation and ensures uninterrupted execution of calculations.
