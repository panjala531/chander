Initially, we replicated only DDLs, but this caused view creation failures due to missing dependencies (RFR DB)

we're now replicating both DDL and data.

Before proceeding, we're:

Backing up the existing ARIP DB (to prevent data loss as replication will replace the existing DB and we may loose the Access again),

Setting up temporary replication from QAP East to QAE East for validation.
