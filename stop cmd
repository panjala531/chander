I hope you are doing well.

I would like to request your approval to increase our Snowflake warehouse from SMALL to MEDIUM.

This change is needed to ensure smooth operations during role-based execution in our process â€” specifically, LQT using the LQT role and warehouse, and ARI using the ARI role and warehouse. This setup avoids disconnects during operational rotation and ensures that calculations run without interruption.
