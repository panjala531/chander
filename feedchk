Develop a Feed Check Monitor for Snowflake feeds to verify that all expected feeds arrive on time and contain valid data.
Validate that feeds are arriving within their expected timeframes.
Check the slice timestamp (SLC TM) of the data to ensure it's within the specified thresholds (e.g., 120 minutes)
Verify feeds based on criteria such as:
     business date matches the expected date.
     data falls within specific start-of-day (SOD) and end-of-day (EOD) ranges.

The system will reference configuration files (e.g., in the API feature config folder) containing:
Feed names.
Expected arrival times.
Associated Snowflake tables (e.g., "AIR IP" database).

Reference and adapt the existing S3 Feed Check Monitor (written by Craig) to handle Snowflake credentials and queries.
If any issues are detected (e.g., missing feeds or data outside thresholds), generate alerts.
Send notifications via email based on the configuration.
